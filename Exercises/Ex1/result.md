3. The program swaps between running each thread it then combines the two threads and prints the value of 'i'. the value of i is continously incremented when running thread 1 and continously decremented while running thread 2. if thread 1 has read the variable before the program swaps but still has not written the new value. then all changes to 'i' will be overwritten when the program swaps back say e.g('-'=read, '>'=write) 5-(swaps thread)>4->3->2(swaps thread)->6->7->8-(swaps thread)>7->6->5->9(swaps thread)->10->11(swaps thread)->10.
